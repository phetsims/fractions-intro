# Fraction-intro model

This simulation offers multiple pictorial representations of a fraction and targets students who are working on 
understanding fractions and equivalence between fractions. The numerator and denominator of the fraction can be 
controlled via spinners. Improper fractions can be generated by increasing the max value beyond one with the uses 
of spinners. There are six representations of a fraction, namely a circular, vertical bar, horizontal bar, beaker, 
cake and number line. For the first five representations, there is an accompanying bucket from which one can draw 
additional pieces. Setting a piece into a container increases the numerator by one. Additionally, pieces can be 
dragged out a container leading to a decrease of the numerator.  Toggling between the different representations
shows a a pictorial representation of equivalent fractions. The number line representation has a marker point that 
can be dragged.
